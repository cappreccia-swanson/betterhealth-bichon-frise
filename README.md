This is my recreaton of an animal trading card.
Of course, my favorite animal is a Bichon Frise
I imagined man's best friend also being a biometric, thermal scanning life support pal.
Dogs are trained to sniff out cancers and are therapeutic for emotional support.
Imagine a life where your best friend never had to leave you due to illness or old age;
and having the ability to alert about heart rate or body temperature spikes;
or alerting the authorities for home invasion o natural disaster alerts;

This is my first project for my Front End Nano Degree Program
