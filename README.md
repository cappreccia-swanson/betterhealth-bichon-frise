This is my recreaton of an animal trading card.

Of course, my favorite animal is a Bichon Frise.

I imagined man's best friend also being a biometric, thermal scanning life support pal.

Dogs are trained to sniff out cancers and are therapeutic for emotional support.

+ Imagine a life where your best friend never had to leave you due to illness or old age;
+ Has the ability to alert about heart rate or body temperature spikes;
+ Can alert authorities for home invasions or other threats;
+ Severe weather and/or natural disaster alerts;
+ Satelite and GPS technologies;
+ and so many other possibilities!

This is my first project for my Front End Nano Degree Program
